public                          Marks a member as accessible from an object variable and derived classes.

private                        Marks a method as accessible only by the class that has defined the method. 
                               In C#, all members are private by default.

protected                      Marks a method as usable by the defining class, and any derived classes. 
                               Protected methods are not accessible from an object variable.
