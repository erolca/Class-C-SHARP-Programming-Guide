/*
 * An interface provides no implementation.
 * Interfaces are declared by using the interface keyword.
 * Here is a simplified form of an interface declaration:
 * 
 * interface name {
        ret-type method-name1(param-list);
        ret-type method-name2(param-list);
        // ...
        ret-type method-nameN(param-list);
    }
