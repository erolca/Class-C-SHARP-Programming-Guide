/*
 
 In C#, two or more methods within the same class can share the same name, as long as their parameter declarations are different.
These methods are said to be overloaded
The process is referred to as method overloading.
Method overloading is one of the ways to implement polymorphism.
It is not sufficient for two methods to differ only in their return types.
The methods must differ in the types or number of their parameters.
